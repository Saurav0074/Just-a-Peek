# Just-a-Peek

This repository contains solutions to problems ranging to Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision that I had been assigned as my application assessment for various AI-based organisations! All efforts have been made to explain each solution as neatly as time had allowed with the major objective of helping a newbie understand the real-world problems related to the domains of AI.

[Fragma Data Systems Assignment](https://github.com/Saurav0074/Fragma-Coding-Assessment): Requires to build a binary Classification Machine Learning Model for the given marketing analytics data. **Topics covered**: _Principal Component Analysis, Min-max Scaler, Machine learning classifiers, Grid Search Algorithm, Voting Classifier, Precision-Recall-Fscore based accuracy metric_

[Advenio Tecnosys](https://github.com/Saurav0074/Advenio): Requires an image segmentation task using the given image of retina. The main objective behind the task was to evaluate one's skills in thinking through the problem and the way or ways to solve it, particularly to see the approach towards solving the problem. **Topics covered**: _Watershed algorithm, Color-space conversion using OpenCV_

[Named Entity Recognition Tagging using LSTM based neural network](https://github.com/Saurav0074/Understanding-LSTM-arch/tree/NER-Tagging):  A self-made tutorial explaining the use of Unidirectional and Bidirectional LSTM Models for NER tagging using `wikigold.conll` data set. **Topics covered**: _Unidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, Keras Sequential Model, Confusion Matrix_
